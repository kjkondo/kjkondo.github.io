<h2 id="post_title"><u>Early Design</u></h2>
<p id="post_contents">
  
  There is a lot of limitation of how this website is designed. 
  I am loading all of the post HTML files through Github's api.
  The more posts there are the larger the REST API response payload becomes.
  
  Additionally, modern fucntions are more difficult to implement due the lack of server-side.
  
  Creating posts are also an issue, I would like to use HTML but doing it every time would be annoying.

  ðŸ’¡Idea : 
  <ul>
    <li>Add function to replace current posts implementation with integration with Obsidian markdown files.</li>  
  </ul>
</p>
